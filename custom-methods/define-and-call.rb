# Define and Call Methods

# methods - thought of as packages of instructions that can be reused and customized
# best practices - written in lower case and underscores
# must be defined before they're called

# define a method
def welcome
  puts "hello there"
end

# call a method
welcome

# methods can be redefined without resulting in an error
